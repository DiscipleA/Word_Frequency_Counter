# Word_Frequency_Counter
 Assignment IT212: Building Simple Word Frequency Counter

This Java program reads text input from the user and calculates the frequency of each word in the text using a HashMap.

üöÄ How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter a block of text.
- The text input is split into words and normalized to lowercase for case-insensitive frequency count.
- A HashMap is used to store the words as keys and their frequencies as values.
- Iteration over words counts the frequency of each word and updates the HashMap accordingly.
- Finally, the program prints each word and its frequency in alphabetical order.

üõ† Features

- Prompts user for text input for word frequency calculation.
- Splits and normalizes the input text for word frequency analysis.
- Utilizes a HashMap to store words and their frequencies.
- Iterates through words to calculate word frequencies.
- Prints out words and their corresponding frequencies sorted alphabetically.
